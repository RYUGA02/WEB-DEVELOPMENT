    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Since Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I have been teaching a course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

        <ul type="circle">
            <li><i>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</i></li>
